# QuillCTF: Unlock your web3 security skills

### Why **QuillAudits CTF?**

Quill CTF is a game in which you hack Ethereum smart contracts to learn about security. It's meant to be both fun and educational. The game is designed to educate players on how to identify and fix security issues in Ethereum smart contracts.

The challenges contain several of the most common vulnerabilities found in Ethereum smart contracts today, including reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, predictable randomness, and more!
